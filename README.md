Abstract:
Our project is exploring our ability to create a model that predicts short-term price movement for FAANG stocks based on historical price pattern, trading volume, and volatility indicators. Our goal is to provide actionable insight into price trends using statistical and machine learning techniques. We cleaned our data set of all irrelevant columns like revenue and gross profit, and filled in missing variables to make the data set easier to use performing our exploratory data analysis. The analysis prioritized columns such as the average close price, emphasizing the importance of selecting features that directly contribute to understanding historical price trends, trading volume dynamics, and volatility indicators. We then compared these selected columns over the five companies, using graphs and correlation maps to compare the results. This targeted approach ensures the inclusion of variables most relevant to capturing the market-sensitive patterns essential for predictive modeling. To get a full grasp we needed to engineer new features to show new trends and patterns th. One feature we used was rolling averages which are statistical measures used to smooth out fluctuations in stock price data by averaging the values over a specified period. They are particularly useful for identifying trends and mitigating the impact of short-term volatility or noise in financial data. For our assignment the rolling averages were used to show the behind the scene trends of stock price by reducing the impact of short term spikes or drops which is incredibly helpful when creating a predictive model. With these rolling averages we applied them to the average closing price to show the trend of the overall prices of each company. We also used these rolling averages to implement Bollinger Bands to measure the volatility of the stock price. With this analysis we began to create the predictive model. We started with a regression model. The model finds correlations between market dynamics and future stock prices by utilizing elements like rolling averages, Bollinger Bands, and lagged price values. Stronger predictability is shown for less volatile stocks like Apple and Google, as the regression model is trained to reduce prediction errors and its effectiveness is assessed using metrics like RMSE and MAE. Although the model is good at identifying patterns in normal circumstances, market noise and other uncontrollable variables restrict its accuracy, indicating room for improvement using more sophisticated methods. The regression model did a great job forecasting the stock prices for the following day. Given the size of the data, the model's forecasts often differ from the actual stock prices by just 2.10, as indicated by the Mean Absolute Error of 2.10. Nearly 99.77% of the variance in stock prices can be explained by the model, according to the R^2 value of 0.9977. This is further supported by the prediction vs. actual price visualization, which shows a good correlation between the two values with the majority of points falling along the diagonal line. We then compared our regression model to a classification model. The main formula was determining whether the price would increase or decrease in the short term. To do this we created a new column called price direction. We ran into some issues with our classification model because our model wasn't very accurate with an accuracy score of 50%. To improve this we tried to find which features of the data had the most predictive power. We found that the importance level was similar for all the features, which left us with the same 0.5 accuracy on our classification model. Using historical price patterns, volume, and volatility indicators, the experiment showed that regression models outperform categorization models in forecasting short-term price fluctuations in FAANG stocks. The regression model demonstrated great accuracy, demonstrating both little error and strong predictive ability. However, even after considerable feature engineering, the classification model, which was intended to predict whether the price will go up or down, performed poorly with an accuracy of 50%, which is comparable to random guessing. According to these findings, classification models could need more data or different approaches to perform better, but regression models are more appropriate for accurate price prediction. Overall, the results demonstrate the viability and accuracy of regression-based methods in capturing
